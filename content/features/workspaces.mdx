- **Best for:** Team projects, client work

## Best Practices

### Workspace Design Tips

**Start Simple**
- Begin with blocking 3-5 major distractions
- Add one essential work app
- Test for a few days before making changes

**Be Specific**
- Name workspaces clearly ("Client Calls" not "Work Stuff")
- Use descriptive colors (blue for technical, green for creative)
- Set up workspaces for specific types of work, not general "work"

**Regular Maintenance**
- Review blocked apps monthly
- Update app launch lists when you install new software
- Archive workspaces you no longer use

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Over-blocking**
- Don't block too many apps initially - you might need some for legitimate work
- Start with obvious distractions and add more gradually

**Under-blocking**
- If you keep getting distracted, you probably need stricter blocking
- Consider switching from blocklist to whitelist mode for deeper focus

**Poor naming**
- "Workspace 1" doesn't tell you what it's for
- Use action-oriented names: "Morning Writing" or "Client Review"

### Troubleshooting

**Apps not launching:**
- Check that apps are actually installed on your Mac
- Verify FocusMode has accessibility permissions
- Try launching the app manually first to test

**Window positioning not working:**
- Grant accessibility permissions in System Settings
- Some apps resist positioning - try different position settings
- Full-screen apps can't be repositioned

**Blocking not effective:**
- Make sure the workspace is actually active during focus sessions
- Check your blocking mode (blocklist vs whitelist)
- Some system apps can't be blocked for stability

**Template apps missing:**
- Templates automatically adapt to your installed apps
- Install missing apps to unlock full template functionality
- Customize templates to match your specific app preferences

## Tips for Success

### Building Good Workspace Habits

1. **Create workspace switching routines**
   - Switch workspaces when changing task types
   - Use workspace colors as visual cues
   - Set up keyboard shortcuts for quick switching

2. **Combine with other FocusMode features**
   - Link workspaces to specific task types
   - Use with Pomodoro timer for timed focused work
   - Enable analytics to track workspace effectiveness

3. **Iterate and improve**
   - Start with basic setups and refine over time
   - Pay attention to what actually distracts you
   - Adjust blocking rules based on real usage patterns

### Advanced Workspace Strategies

**Time-based workspaces:**
- "Morning Deep Work" - strict blocking for early focus
- "Afternoon Communications" - allow chat and email
- "Evening Learning" - research-friendly with educational sites

**Project-based workspaces:**
- Set up temporary workspaces for major projects
- Include project-specific apps and block irrelevant ones
- Archive when projects complete

**Context switching:**
- Create "transition" workspaces between major task types
- Use lighter blocking between focused work sessions
- Build in buffer time for workspace switching

Workspaces are most effective when they become a natural part of your workflow. Start simple, experiment with different configurations, and gradually build a system that truly supports your most productive work patterns.
