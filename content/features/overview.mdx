## General Settings

### Hide Disabled Features

**Available to:** Pro users only

**Permissions required:** None

**Purpose:** Removes disabled features from the application interface for a cleaner, more minimalist experience.

When enabled, any features you've turned off will be completely hidden from menus, buttons, and interfaces throughout the app. This creates a streamlined environment tailored to your specific workflow without visual clutter from unused functionality.

## Core Features

### Pomodoro Timer

**Available to:** All users (Free tier includes basic functionality)

**Permissions required:** None

**Purpose:** Manage work sessions and breaks automatically to prevent burnout and maintain sustainable productivity.

The Pomodoro Timer implements the time-tested Pomodoro Technique, alternating between focused work sessions and scheduled breaks. When enabled, the timer runs in the background and manages your work rhythm automatically.

**How it works:**
- Starts focused work sessions of configurable duration
- Automatically triggers break notifications when work sessions end
- Tracks break compliance and warns if breaks are skipped
- Integrates with all other features to pause/resume during breaks
- Can run in floating timer mode for constant visibility

**Combinations with other features:**

### Workspaces

**Available to:** Pro users only

**Permissions required:** Accessibility access

**Purpose:** One-click environment switching that blocks distractions and opens work-relevant applications.

Workspaces create predefined computing environments for different types of work. Each workspace defines which applications should be accessible and which should be blocked during focus sessions.

**How it works:**
- Configure multiple workspaces (e.g., "Deep Work", "Writing", "Research")
- Define allowed and blocked applications for each workspace
- One-click activation blocks distracting apps and can open required work apps
- Automatically positions application windows according to saved layouts
- Integrates with system application blocking to prevent access to distracting software
